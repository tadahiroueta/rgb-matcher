## Features

### Colour algorithm
The player is prompted with a random colour (RGB value) and is tasked to adjust the sliders to recreate the colour. The lower the mean distance between the RGB values, the higher the score.

> Made entirely programatically

### High Score retention
The player's high score is stored locally and will be accessible whenever the user plays again.

### Dynamic sideways display
Constraints are set to dynamically update when the iPhone is turned to its side for more comfort
